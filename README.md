<h3>Hi, my name is Ivo Stinghen and welcome to my Augment Reality & IBM Watson Voice Recognition Unity Game Repository! (you can breath now)
<h4>This repository comes with a demo game, including 2 Levels, 
each with different goals, but the same objective, learn english.
Due to it's funny and ludic scenario using augment reality cards and speaking to complete quests, children had more desire to learn English.  </h4>

This is a free, open source game, so fell free to download it and contact me for any questions.

<h4>What is the main structure used here?

- Unity as a graphic engine
- C#
- Vuforia, to track AR card position
- IBM Watson, to tell me whether the word was said right or not. 

<h4>What you can do inside the game?

- Walk and interact with the level and object in augment reality.

- Listen, Read and Speak very easy english words, so the correct answear will lead you to a next part of the level.
